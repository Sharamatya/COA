# Booth's Multiplie

To understand the Booth's algorithm for multiplication of numbers, let's take an example:

```md
To multiply: 
	X = 123 and Y = -117

In binary representations (8-bit):
	X<sub>2</sub> = 01111011
	Y<sub>2</sub> = 10001011

Let X be the multliplicand and Y be the multiplier, initialize an 8-bit binary number A with 0 and a 1-bit binary number also with 0
	A = 00000000
	Q<sub>-1</sub>



```
